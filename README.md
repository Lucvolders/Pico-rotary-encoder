Theare are two libraries.

The first is the general MicroPython library made by Mike Teachman
called rotary.py

The second is called rotary_irq_pico.py and is made by Martin Evans.

Copy both files and put them in your lib folder.

Both are needed for getting a rotary encoder working
on the Raspberry Pi Pico
